## Project Idea 

Our Project is a Bulletin Board where Users can upload files with a comment to share it with other users.
The files will be saved in a folder and can be accessed with the file name. 
There Is also a Admin who has the rights to list and delete files

## Issues
- Only one Database table for any kind of informations
- Filter for the table is conntrolled via data from the client
- Non encrypted Passwords
- Bad session management
- Endpoint that provides direct acces to a terminal / Filesystem
- Bulletin Board that has no filter for JS
